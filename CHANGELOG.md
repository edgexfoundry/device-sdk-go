## [v3.0.0] Minnesota - 2023-05-31 (Only compatible with the 3.x releases)

### Features ✨
- Add Start method to the ProtocolDriver interface ([#453fffe](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/commit/453fffe39844267b7c3d359e90be35c08d562c07))
  ```text
  BREAKING CHANGE: Added required `Start` method to the ProtocolDriver interface. 
                   This method is called after the sdk has been completely initialized.
                   This is where device service should implement post initialization code. 
  ```
- Add PatchDevice and DeviceExistsForName and refactor UpdateDeviceOperatingState([#]())
  ```text
  BREAKING CHANGE: SetDeviceOperatingState has been removed, and UpdateDeviceOperatingState has been modified to accept a models.OperatingState value.
  ```
- Using url.PathUnescape for decoding API path ([#cdd8b0f](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/commit/cdd8b0f4c44e4c2644a3f6043fa9547e0633c97a))
  ```text
  BREAKING CHANGE: Use PathUnescape for decoding API path to consist with the change from MQTT topic, the MQTT topic path will encode with url.PathEscape.
  ```

  ```text
  BREAKING CHANGE: Move Discover(), ValidateDevice() to the ProtocolDriver interface to that they are required like the existing interfaces. 
                   This forces at a minimum an empty implementation which gives exposure to the developer that they exist.
                   Use interfaces.ProtocolDriver instead of any as parameter
  ```
