# What architectures to build the snap on
architectures:
  - build-on: amd64
  - build-on: arm64

# The "stability" of the snap and what users can expect from it
# Note that "devel" grade cannot be released to stable or candidate channels
grade: stable
confinement: strict

apps:
  device-simple:
    # `adapter` specifies what kind of environment variables need to be setup
    # for the app, since our app is a statically compiled go app, we don't 
    # need any of the env vars, but if this was a c program or used cgo, we 
    # would need adapter: full
    adapter: none
    command: bin/device-simple --registry $CONFIG_PRO_ARG $CONF_ARG
    # Since we can't include the colon ':' characters in the command above,
    # we need to specify the consul address in an env var like so
    # see https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1827392 for more details
    environment:
      CONFIG_PRO_ARG: "--cp=consul.http://localhost:8500"

    # The service is a simple service that is directly exec'd and expected to
    # always run in a single long-lived process
